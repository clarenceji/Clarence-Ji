•King's College London, 2013 - 2016
BSc Computer Science (Still Attending)
¶At King's College (KCL), I am able to meet new people, to learn about the community, and study what I need. I love studying computer science not only because people say it is easy to find a job, but also because technology can help human beings to achieve great things.
In the college, I am a committee member of KCL Tech Society, which brings students with programming workshops, social events and talks by people from the industry. My weekly job as a team member is to provide support at the iOS programming workshops.

¶I felt lucky to move to and study in Beijing, where my life was enormously changed. With my teacher's and my hard working, I achieved the highest mark of Applied Information and Communication Technology Exam 2013 in China. Also, I was the vice-president of our student union. A number of events were orginized successfully during that period of time. At the end I graduated as a straight A student.
