I, Clarence, was born in Harbin, China on August 17, 1995. I was just a simple guy who could only study at school, practice the piano at home, and repeat the same thing again and again. Until my 16, everything was changed.
¶I, the simple guy, decided to make some difference, not taking the traditional Chinese education anymore. Then my family moved to Beijing, the capital of China, preparing for my next step.
Time flies and I finished my study in Beijing and moved to London to make myself more 'complicated', trying not to be 'too young too simple'.
With the new city and new friends, I have been able to learn a number of new skills, including iOS development.
¶After all those things happend in my life, I started to think backwards. I realized that myself is still the simple guy, who belive that life is good and every one is enjoying it. I'm still the guy who would like to acquire more knowledge and is ready for any challenges in the future. All I found is that things were changed are the surroundings.
