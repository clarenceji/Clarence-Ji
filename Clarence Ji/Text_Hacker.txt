As a computer science student, I have learned on data structure, computer systems, logic, operating system, concurrency, etc. As a 'hacker', I have acquired programming languages including Java and Swift.
¶Wait, 'hacker'? I mean the hackathon hacker. There are more and more hackathons in UK these years and I am proud to be a part of an award-winning hackathon team. By the way, I also put a lot of my efforts on the design and user experience of my developement projects.

¶∞TechCrunch Disrupt London 2014
¶∞MLH Launch Hack 2014
¶∞EikonHack 2014
¶•List of hackathons attended as an organizer or as a volunteer:

¶∞MLH Landing Hack 2015
¶Also, since we have several successful apps built on hackathons, my team decided to continue working on those as our non-academic development projects:
