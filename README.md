**Clarence Ji** is the name of an iOS app that was used to apply for Apple Worldwide Developer Conference student scholarship in 2015.
It is not and will not be pushlished on the App Store due to the [App Review Policy](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/), however, this app helped me win the scholarship and made me possible to attend the conference. <br />
The main technical achievement is the use of barometers that were added to iPhone 6 and later models. The theme (bright / dark) changes depending on the readings from barometer.

#### Usage of Altimeter in iPhone
This project makes use of the `CMAltimeter` class in `CoreMotion` framework to get readings from the built-in altimeter in any iPhone later than iPhone 6.
